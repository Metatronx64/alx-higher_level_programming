# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

This project focuses on the concept of inheritance in Python and aims to strengthen your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP). By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without relying on external resources:

General:
- The awesomeness of Python programming
- Superclass, baseclass, and parentclass concepts
- Subclass definition and its relationship with the superclass
- How to list attributes and methods of a class or instance
- Adding new attributes to instances
- Inheriting a class from another
- Creating a class with multiple base classes
- The default class that every class inherits from
- Overriding methods or attributes inherited from the base class
- Availability of attributes and methods to subclasses through inheritance
- The purpose and benefits of inheritance
- Usage of isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions

- Learn to Program 10: Inheritance Magic Methods

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file is mandatory and should be placed at the root of the project folder
- Code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) style guide
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be checked using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should end with a new line
- All test files should be placed inside a `tests` folder
- Test files should have the `.txt` extension
- Test cases should be executed using the command `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- Modules should include documentation accessible through `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- Classes should include documentation accessible through `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
- Functions (inside and outside classes) should include documentation accessible through `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- Documentation should be meaningful and provide a clear explanation of the module, class, or method's purpose. The length of the documentation will be verified.
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to ensure coverage of various scenarios and edge cases.

Let's dive into the fascinating world of inheritance and enhance our Python programming skills!
